# ☀️ Solar Powered Irrigation System 🌱

## 📘 Overview

The **Solar Powered Irrigation System** is designed to automate agricultural irrigation using renewable solar energy and real-time field data. This system detects soil moisture levels and intelligently controls water delivery to crops using a **microcontroller (Arduino Uno)**, a **soil moisture sensor**, and a **solar-powered pump**.

This project addresses the critical issues of water scarcity, energy efficiency, and sustainable farming by reducing manual labor and resource waste.

## 🌾 Key Features

- ☀️ Solar-powered water pump using photovoltaic panels
- 🌱 Real-time soil moisture monitoring with sensors
- ⚡ Automated pump control via Arduino
- 💧 Optimized water usage to prevent over-irrigation
- 🔋 Energy-efficient with solar charge and PWM control
- 📊 LCD interface for live system status

---

## 🛠️ Hardware Used

- **Arduino Uno** – Controls sensors and motor driver
- **Soil Moisture Sensor** – Measures water content in soil
- **L298 Motor Driver Module** – Controls DC motor (pump)
- **Water Pump (3–6V DC)** – Delivers water when needed
- **Solar Panel (12V)** – Primary energy source
- **Battery** – Stores solar energy for use when sunlight is low
- **LCD Display** – Displays system status and alerts

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Soil moisture sensor** measures current water levels in soil.
2. **Arduino** reads the sensor data and decides whether irrigation is required.
3. If soil is dry:
   - Arduino activates **L298 motor driver** to turn on the **water pump**.
4. **Solar panel** charges the battery and powers the system.
5. The **LCD** shows current readings and pump status.

## 📈 Results

- Reduced water wastage by over **50%** in test fields.
- Smart PWM control reduced **battery overheating** and extended its life.
- Automated moisture-based control helped maintain consistent soil hydration.
- Significant **reduction in manual labor** and **increased crop efficiency**.
